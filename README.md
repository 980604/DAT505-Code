# DAT505-Code
MY name is Xinyu Qian.

this is a directory that includes code projects for DAT505 module

In this project, we have learned some basic knowledge about threejs.

In session 1, we have learned how to create geometries and change its size ,so I have treid to combine the two different geometries, referring to the example the teacher gave.

In session 2, we have learned some code of matrials such as MeshNoramlMaterial. Meanwhile, I took some notesï¼š

MeshBasicMaterial
The basic material is used to give the geometry a simple color or to display the wireframe of the geometry.
MeshNormalMaterial	 
According to the normal vector, the color of the object surface is calculated.
MeshLambertMaterial	 
This  material is used to create dim and unlighted objects.
MeshPhongMaterial	 
This material is used to create bright objects.
Furthermore, I have used some pictures to creat my unique material and tried to create my unique pattern, which looks like a flower.

In session 3, we have learned how to add controllers to control the scale, position and rotation of the cube.Therefore,I completed the controllers.

In session 4, we have learned to control the numbers of  geometries with the method of putting them into an array.
There are 3 exercise. In the first exercise, I have changed the color of arraies. In the second one, I have madee cubes rotate randomly and individually. In the last one, I have did some try.

In session 6,I also did some exploration to master basic skills.


In session 7, I made the interaction with eyes. The eyes can move as the mouse moves.

In session 8, I improved the interaction that all the eyes can look at the mouse.Then, in the second folder, if the mouse clicks, the geometries can change their size and color randomly in 3D space.In the third folder, I have imported 3D objects. If the mouse touches them, they will turn red. However, this exercise needs to be waited for a long time.

In session 9, I have added audio source and learned some shaders.What is important is that some shaders cannot be realized.

In conclusion, we had a preliminary understanding of threejs during the 3-week learning.
